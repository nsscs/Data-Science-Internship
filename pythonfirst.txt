#   Basics of Python and Machine Learning

### 1. Getting started with Machine learning

Machine learning is a set of statistical techniques and algorithms designed to find and use structure and patterns in data to make interesting predictions
or provide cool insights. Organizations use machine learning for all kinds of applications: whether it’s translating text from one language to another and many others.

#### 1.1 The Data Science process
      When a non-technical supervisor/client asks you to solve a data problem, the description of your task can be quite ambiguous at first. It is up to you, as the data scientist,
      to translate the task into a concrete problem, figure out how to solve it and present the solution back to  all of your stakeholders.
      The steps involved in this workflow the “Data Science Process.” This process involves several important steps:
      
        * Frame the problem: 
              
              The goal is to get into your client’s or user's head and understand their view of the problem as well as you can.
              This knowledge will be invaluable later when you analyze your data and present the insights you find within.
              Once you have a reasonable grasp of the domain, you should ask more pointed questions to understand exactly what your client wants you to solve. 
              Start by asking a lot of questions about the customers, sales process, tiers of service and so on to get knowledge about the domain. 
              Next step is to figure out what data you have available to answer these question.
         
        * Collect the right data :
            In most data science industry projects, you will be using data that already exists and is being collected. The data is collected from the the 
            data generated by the sales department is stored in the company’s CRM software, and managed by the Sales Operations team.
            The data  collected is still ‘raw data’ — which is very likely to contain mistakes, missing and corrupt values. So data wrangling has to be done.
            
        *  Data Wrangle:
            First, you need to look through the data that you’ve extracted, and make sure you understand what every column means. We have to look into various details such as 
            missing values, data range , time zones for validation and many other details depending on the problem assigned. Data must be clean by recovering missing values 
            
        *
